# Quiz Game
A simple quiz built with React 18.2.0. 

### What is this project about?
This project is a take home test project for one of the companies I applied to. 
### How To Start A Project?
 - install all dependencies
 `yarn install`
 - start the server
  `yarn start`
 - open server
  `http://localhost:3000/`

### The biggest issue
The biggest issue is that I have been out of the loop with the newest shiniest things in React so I had to quickly get myself up to date with `react-router-dom`, for example.

### QuestionsPage component
This component handles all of the logic for state of questions and their routes.

### Features left to implement
I think this project would be improved if I add some cool things like:
 - typescript
 - testing
 - linters

### Git branches
Since this is a simple project, I used only one branch, but in real life I would use Git flow, that means I would separate branches by features.
